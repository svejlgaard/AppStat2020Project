# AppStat2020Project

From the course webpage: The project should be written in Physical Review Letter style (or something close to it, if you don't like Latex) thus not more than 3-4 pages! You do not need to describe the experiments themselves (assume the reader is a fellow student, who has also done the experiments), but of course all measurements, details and results should be described, such that the reader can follow (i.e. calculate themselves) your results fully and reproduce what you have done.
